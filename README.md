# Arma3 Server Administration

> This repository is to help those who wish to have a modded Arma3 server with their existing hardware, today, within the next 2.5 hours.
> You will need to follow this guide, and grab some things before this is possible.

## The Rules To Win Quick

1) First, do not use the regular steam client on the machine you wish to use as the server. This will make you unable to play on your account, because the server will be logged in as your user and you will get rejected.

2) Start with a fresh machine with decent resources. i5+, 4096MB Ram+, 20Mbps+ (AT THE VERY LEAST), and an SSD is perferred but not required, you will need 30+ Gigs of space. If you plan to mod the server, you may also need to install those mods, and they can come with a large data storage price. We recommend a 1TB drive or a 512GB SSD.

3) You will need a mouse, keyboard, monitor, internet connection, and access to the machine. This is in no way shape or form a headless install. You need to have physical access to that machine and the router of the network it is on!

4) Take things slow when choosing mission files and mods, creating conflicts by installing everything at once, will result in a denial for help when something goes wrong. We cannot help you learn to use a computer, practice common sense.

## Software You Need

Windows 10 is free to install. You just cant change desktop look and feel without having a license.

This is for making sure things are running smooth, as we all know task manger does not always suffice when dealing with Arma.

https://desktop.github.com/
This is to download the repositories of code, and tools being provided, slowly but surely.

https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.7.html
This is for editing text files when configuring more complex setups. Not required but highly recommended.
